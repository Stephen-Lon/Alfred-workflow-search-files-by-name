# Alfred-workflow-search-files-by-name
A Universal Action to search files by name in a selected folder (and, optionally, its sub-folders)

# Introduction

This workflow enables you to search in a selected folder (and, optionally, its subfolders) for files the name of which includes your search word (or consecutive words) and returns those files in Alfred. (Note: "word" in this context can be any sequence of characters or numbers.) You can choose whether or not to include subfolders in the search. It is used as a Universal Action on a selected folder in Finder.

# Why not simply rely on [Alfred's file search](https://www.alfredapp.com/help/features/file-search/)?

Sometimes when browsing with Finder you have a rough idea of where a file is and then it's easy and quick to use this Universal Action (searching the results if necessary). However, my principal use for this workflow is to search an occasionally mounted volume the contents of which are not indexed by Spotlight. For that it is fast and effective.

# Important notes

1. The search is case insensitive and will find any occurrence of the search word (or consecutive words if more than one) in the filename (i.e., in effect the search is for \*searchWord\*). 

2. If no file including the search word is found you will see something like this:

![NotFound](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/08e6ca9f-0e58-4432-aa60-92fa053fbd8c)

As indicated simply press `esc` to end the workflow.

# Usage

To run the workflow select a folder in Finder, press your Universal Actions hotkey and look for `Search files by name` in the list of actions. Press <kbd>‚èé</kbd> when it is selected, type the word you wish to find in a filename and then press <kbd>‚èé</kbd> again.

![Search](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/55b59604-48d8-46a1-ab7f-d53b5675c159)



You then have the option to search the selected folder and subfolders or to search only in the selected folder and you will see this:.

![Choose](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f32e96ec-e220-4043-aa01-a8a3a6cadd5a)



Select the option you want (if using the default of search including sub-folders you can simply press <kbd>‚èé</kbd>) and the result of the search will display (here showing where the option to include sub-folders was used):

![Result](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f52361ed-bdcb-4871-b278-b9668f28993c)


There are four things to note:

- If you choose to search *excluding* sub-folders no path is shown for the file. If you *include* sub-folders in your search the path from the principal search folder to the sub-folder is shown.
- The results are searchable‚Äîsimply type in the box at the top of the results.
- Remember that you may need to scroll down to see all of the results. In that context you may find it helpful in `System Settings ‚Üí Appearance` to show scroll bars `Always`‚Äîwhich will help make clear where you are in the list of results when moving through it.
- You can use the workflow if you want a tea or coffee break: just search in a top-level folder and include sub-folders. It will probably churn out the results in the end but you may prefer to end the workflow by pressing <kbd>esc</kbd> before your tea or coffee gets too cold.

You can select any file found and press:

- <kbd>‚èé</kbd> to open the file in the default app for that file type;
- <kbd>‚å•</kbd><kbd>‚èé</kbd> to reveal the file in Finder; or
- <kbd>‚áß</kbd><kbd>‚èé</kbd> to action the file in Alfred.
